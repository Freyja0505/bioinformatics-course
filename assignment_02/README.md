# Assignment 02 – Unix Command Line & GFF3 Analysis

## Course
FastTrack Bioinformatics 2025

## Objective
The goal of this assignment is to practice using Unix command line tools to explore and analyze genomic annotation data in GFF3 format.  
All analyses are performed in a reproducible manner using text-based Unix commands.

## Organism name: Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly)

Drosophila melanogaster is a well-established eukaryotic model organism commonly known as the fruit fly.
It has been extensively used in genetics, developmental biology, and functional genomics.
Its genome is relatively compact and well-annotated, making it suitable for practicing genomic annotation analysis using Unix-based workflows.

## Data Source
The GFF3 annotation file was obtained from the Ensembl public FTP site:

https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/current_gff3/

The data file itself is not included in this repository.  
Only the commands used to download and analyze the data are documented below.
